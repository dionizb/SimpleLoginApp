# SimpleLoginApp
A simple login with apple using SwiftUI + Combine

App doesn't have any external dependencies, so no extra effort required to build or run it. Created on Xcode 13 :) 

User UI is really simple. The focus is more on using Combine and Swift UI together and implementing Unit and UI Tests
